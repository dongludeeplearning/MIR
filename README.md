# MIR

This repository records my research on area of Music Information Retrieve(MIR).
## Part one
The main idea of this part is to combine music theory and data mining technology to explore the inherited meme of a specific region of Chinese folk songs. 

+ Applied improved N-Apriori algorithm to show the shallow music patterns and designed one improved multi-layer melody clustering method based on edit distance contains both direction and value, to refine the most representative structures as the general characteristics of certain region music.

This part was included by 12th Sound and Music Computing Conference Proceedings. [SMC2015](http://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/smc15/files/FinalProceedings.pdf) 
 


## Part two
 The main idea of this part is to improve classification among different regions of Chinese folk songs.

+ Proposed a synthetic feature model with both global and local perspectives. Tested this model by using 10-fold cross-validation with three classifiers- Decision Tree, SVM, Bayesian Network, and two measurements-Accuracy and F-measure. The results indicated this model having the best performance.
